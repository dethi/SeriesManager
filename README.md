# SeriesManager
If you download a lot of series, you've probably notice that the files are named oddly. To obtain a folder "Series" coherent with the file names, I decided to create this little application.

## Functional principle
This application detects the structure of the folder, and renames all the file with the configuration defined (see « Folder structure »).

## Folder struture
Integral folder : [name]
Seasons folders : [name] - S01
Episodes : [name] - S01E01

**NOTES:** To switch to the new folder structure, please use the script entitled *switch2new.py*.

## Advanced Project
- 22/06/12 : I am proud to announce the first alpha test today.
- 06/11/12 : I tested the script on over 60 series, and he managed 96% of tests
